My goal here is to Build a personal portfolio site from scratch, with focus on a mobile first design. take a peak at what i'v built [Live Demo Link](https://abenezer-tilahun.github.io/Microverse-Portfolio-Website/)

## Features implemented so far are:

- Integration of style linters for CSS, web linters for html & Lighthouse for page optimization testing
- Responsive mobile view and web view design using css media-queries, flex-box, and grids
- Integration of formspree for submission of contact details in contact section
- Interactive CSS animations
- Launched and deployed to github pages([Live Demo Link](https://abenezer-tilahun.github.io/Microverse-Portfolio-Website/))
- Implemented navigation menu on mobile with JavaScript events

## Built With

- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for    performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).
- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors).
- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).
- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:
